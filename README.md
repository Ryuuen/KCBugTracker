# KCBugTracker
Community run bug tracker for KanColle. Intended to keep track of which bugs are still active. While trying to be bilingual, some issues might not be available in both languages.

日本語OKです。

## Issue formatting
***Note**: This is still up for discussion. If there are problems/changes wanted, contact me or make an issue with the meta label.*  
To keep the issues somewhat consistent, templates are provided when creating one. In general:
- Titles: if available use `Japanese title | English title`, if only one is available then just use `(Japanse or English) Title`
- Content
  - If available, put Japanese content on top, followed by English content. If one isn't available there's no need to keep the titles for that language.
  - For each available language the general order should be:
    - (Short) description that extends the title.
    - For visual issues, screenshot or video would be handy.
    - (If available) steps to reproduce the issue or test the.
    - For combat/formula issues, the expected result and the current result (showing formulas).
    - (If available) client code that's causing issue and a fix - doesn't need to be available in both languages, can go at end.
  - While linking to Twitter is OK and it's encouraged to link sources, the contents should be copied/archived as well in case the tweet gets deleted on a later date. 

## Contributing issues
### New issues
All issues will be posted in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCBugTracker/issues). First check if an issue already exists before making one. Filtering by tags might help.  
You can use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) and/or [DeepL Translate](https://www.deepl.com/translator) for own reference when looking for duplicates, using a mixture should give a decent idea what it's about (please do not post machine translations).  
Issues can be created via the [New Issue](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCBugTracker/issues/new/choose) button. Several templates will be available to choose from that will fill in some labels and do some formatting. This can also be done manually if wanted.  

### Translating  
Some issues might not be available in both English and Japanese. You can search for open issues that aren't available in [Japanese](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCBugTracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+-label%3Alang%3A%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E) or for ones that aren't available in [English](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCBugTracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+-label%3Alang%3AEnglish)  
If you do not have the rights to edit the main message, you may add your translations in the comments. If you do have permissions, please put your translation in there.

**NOTE**: This README and [some issue templates](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCBugTracker/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) haven't been translated yet to Japanese. These should take priority over translating issues, but feel free to do what you want.
